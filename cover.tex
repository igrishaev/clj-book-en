Clojure in production? Do you mean the language with so many round brackets and no types? That's right. This book will talk about how to build production systems in this language: from the simple to the complex, step by step or from one bracket to another.

Until now, you could find out information on Clojure only in books in English or in scattered online publications. The situation is changing: this is a book about Clojure originally written in Russian. Its author earns his living as a Clojure programmer.

This book is not another introduction to Clojure. The seven chapters emphasizes practice and unobvious things that you are unlikely to find in any training materials. This entire book, from beginning to end, based on the author's personal experience. The code is borrowed from actual projects.
