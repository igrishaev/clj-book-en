To strengthen your knowledge, you should put it into practice as soon as possible.
Start working on a Clojure project to improve your skills.
If the company does not use this language, you can suggest the management an experiment.
Interest colleagues, give a master class and~set up a Clojure project.
Then give a presentation to the management and describe its benefits: immutability, development speed, simplicity.

The Russian community is developing. If you have any problems, please contact
