In this book, I tell about Clojure which is a modern dialect of Lisp. Clojure is
a functional programming language that emphasizes immutability and
concurrency. It was designed ten years ago, and now it's gradually getting
popular. The seven chapters look at using ~Clojure in~production.

If you read this book, I assume that you have some knowledge of Clojure or other
Lisps. You will better understand the material if you have programming
experience. This book is geared to advanced readers.
